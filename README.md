# Microservices project Config, Eureka, Zuul, OAuth2

In this project, I will try to prepare all the infrastructure for microservices and write a couple of my services. 

<!-- ## Microservices architecture:
* **config-service** - centralized point of configurations for services. Let's say that we have 20 or 50 services in your project. It's reasonable to place all configurations in one place. So, when new **service** is running it's communicating with **config-service** to get proper configuration. 
To be able to create configuration server you need:
   - [x] * *@EnableConfigServer* * annotation, 
   - [x] * *spring-cloud-config-server* * dependency. 
 By default server will be run localy on port 8080. To change this behaviour 
* **discovery-service** -  -->
